__Das Enigma__  

*__Das Enigma__ is a command line tool for encrypting and decrypting text files using a simulated Enigma machine. This means that this is not a safe encryption tool, merely a bit of a novelty item. Remember: The codebreakers at Bletchley Park broke this in WOII, based on the fact that a character can never be substituted by the same character in the encrypted message. Furthermore, thanks to increased computational power, we don't have to rely on mechanical encryption anymore.*
